Hi, this is my lab to test to demo. So on the board we see that hacks five and hacks for is this playing the address inputs from switch at four in the hexadecimal four, and the inputs data for bits data from switch three to zero is displayed on text one.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And there is a counter displaying the address it's currently looking through and around

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on hacks, three and four, Austrian chip sorry.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And if we want to input, any value into the data into the room we can just use input data here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Input the address here and address here, and use the key suite for enable rights right enable.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yep. So, now we put one into address zero.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we can just make something make things easy we just go to the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
east wants because it's just more convenient.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So in the next cycle we should see the changes.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Yeah, so like, now we see a displace as the values we previously put in for the address, we previously nuts.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I mean change.
