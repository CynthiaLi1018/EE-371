test one demo. So I'm using the switch, nine, for the right enable, and I'm using switch Hu for as the specified address. So for the demo purpose we will just pick a random address, and it will not see the address will be displaying hacks visible on hacks

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
five and four.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Yeah.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So it will display like updates every clock cycle.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Sorry, the computers.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And so for any address we picked. We can input a data on spurge three to zero.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So if we put on to we can see that the input data will be displayed in hexadecimal on hacks to.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And if we let this go through a clock cycle, which we're using zero.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.000
It will display be read it I'll read the addresses value and display ads on hacks zero.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So if we change the value, we will see that it also updates.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yeah. Oh it's.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If we this enable.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Right. And the week we change it again.
